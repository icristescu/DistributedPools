# elixir_umbrella
Some toy projects in Elixir.

- WorkerPool: my implementation of a distributed worker pool. The application runs in two modes: distributed (a pool is created for each node) and non-distributed. The non distributed version follows the architecture of Benjamin Tan Wei Hao's book.
- Renting: a website
- Rents: a database backed application
